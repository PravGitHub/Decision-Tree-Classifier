# Decision-Tree-Classifier
* A decision tree was built from scratch (no libraries)
* The decision tree was built using information gain as the criteria.
* The tree was trained using a training dataset and tested using a testdataset.
* The accuracy of the predictions is calculated.
* Basic pruning was done to try and improve the accuracy (random pruning may have increased the accuracy)
